# Projectile Motion Simulation (Java Program)

This repository contains a **Java-based simulation tool** that demonstrates the principles of **projectile motion**.  

It was developed as part of an **individual coursework task** in the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) module** at **Victoria University**. The tool allows students to input initial velocity and launch angle, then calculates important characteristics of the projectile such as **time of flight, maximum height, and horizontal range**.

## Background

Projectile motion refers to the curved path that an object follows when it is launched into the air at an angle. It is governed by Newton’s Laws of Motion and can be analyzed by resolving velocity into horizontal and vertical components.

The main physics formulas applied in this program are:

- **Time of Flight (T):**
  T=(2u sin⁡θ )/g

- **Maximum Height (H):**
  H=(u^2  sin^2 ⁡θ)/2g

- **Horizontal Range (R):**
  R=(u^2  sin⁡(2θ))/g

Where:  
- \( u \) = initial velocity (m/s)  
- \( θ \) = launch angle (degrees)  
- \( g \) = gravitational acceleration (9.8 m/s²)

## Features

- Accepts **user input** for initial velocity and launch angle.  
- Calculates:
  - Time of Flight (seconds)  
  - Maximum Height (meters)  
  - Horizontal Range (meters)  
- Displays results in a clear, formatted manner.  
- Demonstrates the application of **Java + Physics equations** in education.
